  * Production: Three people for one week full-time.
  * Statistics: ~10000 pageviews and ~5 GB of data transfered; per day.
  * Performance: CPU usage on server is average 2.14% of which most is MySQL, heap footprint is ~1 MB.

  While fairly simple and without heavy load, this pilot project has proved the speed, agility and robustness of sprout in a commercial production with short deadline.
