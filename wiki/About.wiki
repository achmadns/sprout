[http://singel.spraydate.se Singel] _Valentines day campaign site for Swedish match-making site [http://www.spraydate.se Spraydate]._

  * Production: Three people for one week full-time.
  * Statistics: ~10000 pageviews and ~5 GB of data transfered; per day.
  * Performance: CPU usage on server is average 2.14% of which most is MySQL, heap footprint is ~1 MB.

  While fairly simple and without heavy load, this pilot project has proved the speed, agility and robustness of sprout in a commercial production with short deadline.

  * Production: One person for one week full-time.
  * Performance: The site currently uses MySQL cache, to keep the memory usage low, all pages are served in ~200ms the first time and 20ms the remaining times, data is scraped every hour.

  The production value on this project is high, it took me one week to build something that others have built companies around: [http://www.bovision.se Bovision], [http://www.booli.se Booli], [http://www.boligan.se Boligan]. Only one competitor is a hobbyist [http://www.bospindeln.se Bospindeln].
