#summary Why did I build this.

Because a big part of what programmers do is to create typed data hierarchies that they then wrap in SQL, XML or JSON and send around; which in it's turn gets unwrapped and presented in a similar but often separate hierarchy model on the other end.

With a node-graph data model you only store, send and present nodes. Which makes the storing, wrapping, transport and unwrapping much easier.

How does the old model scale?

- You can add more developers to the project with linearly increased productivity.

How does the new model scale?

- API does not grow as number of objects grows.
- All methods are generic.

So we need a way to describe the hierarchy and I'm working on that.
