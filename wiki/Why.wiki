#summary Why the Node-Graph data model is good.

Because a big part of what programmers do is to create typed data hierarchies that they then wrap in SQL, XML or JSON and send around; which in it's turn gets unwrapped and presented in a similar but often separate implementation on the other end.

With a node-graph data model you only store, send and present nodes.

How does the old model scale?

  # You can add more developers to the project with linearly increased productivity.'*'

How does the new model scale?

  # Code API does not grow as number of objects grows.
  # Lots of methods become generic.
  # You can alter/hotdeploy the storage/transport system in realtime.

So we need a way to document and describe the hierarchy. A DTD for the hierarchy of sorts.
