#labels Featured

There are 4 things your hosting has to provide for you to be able to use sprout:

  # SSH
  # Java (1.4 or 1.5)
  # MySQL (any version)
  # Apache (with mod_proxy)

The easiest way to get this cheaply is to buy a Virtual Private Server (VPS) solution (please add any available providers here, by country then price):

The only tricky part is that you will want to [http://code.google.com/p/rupy/wiki/VirtualHostProxy VirtualHostProxy] your domain in Apache, by entering the following into the apache config, the port number (XXXX below) should be assigned for each instance so that you can run sprout on that port:
{{{
NameVirtualHost *:80
<VirtualHost *:80>
    ServerName yourdomain.com
    ServerAlias www.yourdomain.com
    ProxyPass / http://localhost:XXXX/
    ProxyPassReverse / http://localhost:XXXX/
</VirtualHost>
}}}
*Dependencies:* _Sprout uses [http://rupy.googlecode.com rupy], a "tiny footprint" embedded HTTP server that uses below 1 MB in heap, it is not a problem to run 100 rupy instances on one low end machine._
